Proteins are basic building blocks of life. They are everywhere. Therefore, Metagenomic-DeepFRI
could be applied in a variety of domains. Our group is mostly intrested in functional potential of
human gut microbiome, so we are sharing our results of annotating bacterial genes using DeepFRI.

**We would like to encourage groups outside microbiome research to test our software!**
