abstract={In addition to being an important member of the normal intestinal microflora of humans and other mammals, the species Escherichia coli contains many pathotypes that cause a variety of diseases. At least six different pathotypes cause enteric disease, such as diarrhoea or dysentery, and other pathotypes cause extra-intestinal infections, including urinary tract infections and meningitis.Virulence factors of E. coli can affect a wide range of eukaryotic cellular processes, including cell signalling, ion secretion, protein synthesis, mitosis, cytoskeletal function and mitochondrial function.Virulence factors of pathogenic E. coli are frequently encoded on genetic elements such as plasmids, bacteriophage, transposons and pathogenicity islands that can be mobilized into different strains to create novel combinations of virulence factors.The genomic structure of the E. coli pathotypes that have been sequenced so far show a striking mosaic pattern, with 2,000 genes present in 247 islands in one pathotype that are not present in K-12. Up to 0.53 MB of DNA present in K-12 can also be absent from pathogenic E. coli.Genes that encode virulence factors of pathogenic E. coli are regulated by both pathotype-specific regulators that are absent from commensal E. coli, and by 'housekeeping' regulators that are present in commensal E. coli.},

It finished assembling a soil metagenomics dataset with 252 Gbps in 44.1 and 99.6 h on a single computing node with and without a graphics processing unit, respectively. MEGAHIT assembles the data as a whole, i.e. no pre-processing like partitioning and normalization was needed. When compared with previous methods on assembling the soil data, MEGAHIT generated a three-time larger assembly, with longer contig N50 and average contig length; furthermore, 55.8\\% of the reads were aligned to the assembly, giving a fourfold improvement.Availability and implementation: The source code of MEGAHIT is freely available at https://github.com/voutcn/megahit under GPLv3 license.Contact:rb@l3-bioinfo.com or twlam@cs.hku.hkSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

  abstract  = "Large-scale recovery of genomes from isolates, single cells, and
               metagenomic data has been made possible by advances in
               computational methods and substantial reductions in sequencing
               costs. Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is
               providing key information regarding the evolutionary and
               functional diversity of microbial life, it has become
               impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making
               robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires
               accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination.
               Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and
               generally make use of a limited number of ``marker'' genes
               conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we
               introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality
               of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the
               position of a genome within a reference genome tree and
               information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate
               the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide
               range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes.
               CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome
               completeness and contamination and to outperform existing
               approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors
               currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and
               demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and
               metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to
               facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective
               measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes
               suitable for specific gene- and genome-centric analyses of
               microbial communities.",

              software tool to reconstruct single genomes from microbial
              communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated microbial
              species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools
              largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use,
              especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples
              and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters
              to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters
              are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially
              on assemblies of poor quality. Here we developed MetaBAT 2 to
              overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning
              algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed
              extensive software engineering optimization to increase both
              computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to
              alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome
              assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a
              typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single
              commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community
              adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments.
              MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at
              https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.",

               microbial organisms has improved steadily over the past decade,
               but there is still room for improvement. Increasing the number
               of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation
               initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number
               of false positives, are all desirable goals. RESULTS: With our
               years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint
               Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm
               called Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding
               ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three
               goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved
               translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false
               positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing
               gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these
               objectives. CONCLUSION: We built a fast, lightweight, open
               source gene prediction program called Prodigal
               http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good
               results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be
               a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.",
