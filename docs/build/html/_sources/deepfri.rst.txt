What is DeepFRI?
----------------

To get all the details please refer to original paper

Model overview 
**************

DeepFRI is a deep learning model for prediction of protein function from sequenece and structure. It consists of 2 parts: 

1. Pretrained LSTM - a reccurent neural network pretrained on a large set of protein sequences.
2. Graph convolutional network - a neural network that allows for a representation of the protein structure as a graph.

Pretrained LSTM
***************

LSTM are a type of recurrent neural networks that is effective in sequence problems due to
its ability to infer the relationship between elements of the sequence. This property explains their effectivity 
in many Natural Language Processing tasks.  

LSTM was trained on a corpus of around 10 million protein domain sequences from Pfam. 
The pretraining task was to predict an amino acid residue in the context of its position in a protein sequence.
In the final model, the parameters of the LSTM are frozen - it serves for to encode protein sequence embeddings.

Graph neural network
********************

GCNs have proven to be powerful for extracting features from data that are naturally represented as one or more graphs. 
It was show to be a suitable method for extracting features from proteins by taking into account their 
graph-based structure of inter-connected residues, represented by contact maps.
